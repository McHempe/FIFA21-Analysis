Why have I chosen this Data Set?
I have chosen the FIFA 21 complete player data set because I am completely into Football
and I want to combine my passion with my analytical skills.

Data Cleaning
• Changed sofifa_id Data Type from “int64” to “str”
• Data set does not contain duplicates
• Dropped unnecessary columns:
o player_url
o league_rank
o work_rate
o body_type
o real_face
o player_tags
o team_jersey_number
o loaned_from
o nation_jersey_number
o player_traits
o defending_marking

Basic descriptive statistical analysis
The data set has contained 18944 rows and 106 columns before cleaning and after cleaning
18944 rows and 95 columns.

Limitations and ethics
This data set is limited by its version. It contains all data of FIFA 21 and it does not contain
data from previous editions. This means that it is not possible to analyze a time series. But
the good thing is that data sets from previous FIFA editions are also available to compare
data from different FIFA versions.
